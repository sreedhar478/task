    <p class="bg-success">html stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the structure of a webpage by using a series of elements, tags, and attributes to organize text, images, links, and other multimedia elements.

        HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.
        It forms the building blocks of all websites and is complemented by CSS for style and JavaScript for interactivity.
        It is a static language, meaning that it does not inherently provide interactive features but can be combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.</p>

    <P class="bg-danger">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to style and enhance website presentation.

        CSS is one of the main three components of a webpage along with HTML and JavaScript.
        HTML adds Structure to a web page.
        JavaScript adds logic to it and CSS makes it visually appealing or stylish. It controls the layout of a web page i.e. how HTML elements will be displayed on a webpage.
        CSS was released (in 1996), 3 years after HTML (in 1993). The main idea behind its use is, it allows the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS). This makes websites easier to maintain and more flexible.</P>

     <P class="bg-primary">JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic content for websites. It is a lightweight, cross-platform, and single-threaded programming language. JavaScript is an interpreted language that executes code line by line providing more flexibility.

        HTML adds Structure to a web page, CSS styles it and JavaScript brings it to life by allowing users to interact with elements on the page, such as actions on clicking buttons, filling out forms, and showing animations.
        JavaScript on the client side is directly executed in the user's browser. Almost all browsers have JavaScript Interpreter and do not need to install any software. There is also a browser console where you can test your JavaScript code.</P>
